Oversight of the Project Implemented so far..

Support :

1.Local db crud operations(group management) operational
2. DB Crud operations operational for the application in another device via SMS.
3.SMS sending and receiving operational
4.Succesful displaying of a gcc tile (Offline Maps).
5. GUIDE completed
6. Admin and Member Authentication operational. 

Limitations :

1. Although offline map is displayed but there's no way for adding layers, live location, geofences and other animations in a tile that is independent of an Internet connection. 
2. Here we are assuming that the index/ id(AI and primary key in Groups table)  is the same. If it isn't the same then contacts can be added in different groups making a mess.
3. There's an exception in recieving sms in the admin side(can be handled and fixed) Where as sms recieving in Member side is ok.
